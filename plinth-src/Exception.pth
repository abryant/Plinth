/**
 * An Exception is an object which represents an unusual situation which disrupts the normal execution of a program.
 * Exceptions are usually thrown when the problem should be expected by the programmer. This is in contrast to Errors, which are usually thrown when the problem is unexpected.
 *
 * For example, if a file cannot be opened an Exception should be used, whereas if a list index is out of bounds an Error should be used.
 * This is because the list is directly under the programmer's control and they are expected to do index checks themselves, whereas the file system is not.
