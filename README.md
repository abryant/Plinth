## A Toy Compiler

This project is mainly for me to experiment with writing a very small compiler, and to try implementing an LLVM code generator.

### Instructions

You will need: Java (JDK) >= 1.5, LLVM 3.1, and GCC (for compilation to native code)

To run the compiler, you will need an LLVM shared library to be installed. Specifically, it looks for "LLVM-3.1" (libLLVM-3.1.so on Linux).

To compile the compiler:

    src$ javac -d ../bin -cp ../lib/jna.jar:. **/*.java

To run:

    bin$ java -cp ../lib/jna.jar:. eu.bryants.anthony.toylanguage.compiler.Compiler -d /path/to/output/folder /path/to/source.txt /path/to/source2.txt

To generate machine code from the given LLVM bitcode:

    llc binary.bc
    gcc -c binary.s
    gcc -o binary binary.o

To run your program and check the result:

    ./binary
    echo $?

Alternatively, you can run the LLVM bitcode generated by the compiler directly via the LLVM interpreter:

    lli binary.bc
    echo $?
